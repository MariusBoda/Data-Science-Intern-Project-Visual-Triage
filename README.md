# Machine Learning Module for Patient Disposition Prediction

Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning module from scratch using R that accurately predicts patients' disposition based on vital signs, medical history, and socioeconomic data. The module has been designed to analyze and predict whether a patient should be admitted, discharged, or transferred to another facility.
Features

    - Accurate prediction of patients' disposition based on vital signs, medical history, and socioeconomic data.
    - Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and process the input data.
    - Achieved a sensitivity rate of 91%, indicating the module's ability to correctly identify positive cases.

Dataset Analysis

To train the machine learning algorithm, a dataset containing records of 500,000 patients' data was analyzed and formatted. The dataset underwent preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure optimal performance of the module.
Web Interface

A user-friendly web interface has been developed to interact and test the machine learning module. The interface allows users to input individual patient data and receive a disposition prediction based on the provided information. This feature enables healthcare professionals and researchers to conveniently access the module's capabilities.
Usage

Sensitivity Rate

The machine learning module has achieved a sensitivity rate of 91%. This measure indicates the module's ability to correctly identify patients who should be admitted or transferred based on their input data. A higher sensitivity rate signifies a greater accuracy in predicting positive cases.
