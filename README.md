# Machine Learning Module for Patient Disposition Prediction

**Introduction**

This project aims to develop a machine learning module from scratch using R that accurately predicts patients' disposition based on vital signs, medical history, and socioeconomic data. The module has been designed to analyze and predict whether a patient should be admitted or discharged from the emergency room.

This was a summer project as part of my summer (summer 2020) internship for Detectivio AB. The end goal of the project is to prove that it is possible to implement a system similar to this for doctors and healthcare professionals. Take the example of an elderly man walking into the emergency room; even with limited information about this man, machine learning can help healthcare workers make faster and more accurate decisions. 

**script.R**

Included in this repository is the script file which when run, using a data set can create a machine learning module.

Below is an example of a plot output:

As you can see, inputed data is sorted into one of the two catagories: Admit or Discharge.

Here is a plot of the different features that are used to make the prediction:

**Features**

   - Accurate prediction of patients' disposition based on vital signs, medical history, and socioeconomic data.
   - Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and process the input data.
   - Achieved a sensitivity rate of 91%, indicating the module's ability to correctly identify positive cases.

**Dataset Analysis**

To train the machine learning algorithm, a dataset containing records of 500,000 patients' data was analyzed and formatted. The dataset underwent preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure optimal performance of the module.

**Web Interface**

A user-friendly web interface was developed to interact and test the machine learning module. The interface allows users to input individual patient data and receive a disposition prediction based on the provided information. This feature enables healthcare professionals and researchers to conveniently access the module's capabilities.
Usage

**Sensitivity Rate**

The machine learning module has achieved a sensitivity rate of 94%. This measure indicates the module's ability to correctly identify patients who should be admitted or transferred based on their input data. A higher sensitivity rate signifies a greater accuracy in predicting positive cases.

**Contact Information**

I welcome feedback, bug reports, and contributions from the community to further enhance the script.
